To create documentation and then a minimum demonstration about how you as the developer will execute/develop this user story: "As a Facebook user, I want to see my Facebook post performance on a separate dashboard application."

Documentation:
Step 1: Compiling the Needs
Goal: Gain an understanding of the user's requirements and the Facebook data at hand.
Tasks: Conduct requirements interviews with stakeholders.
As certain the essential performance indicators that consumers desire to view, such as likes, comments, shares, and reach.
Find the Facebook Graph API endpoints required for the retrieval of post data.

Step 2:
Design Goal: Arrange the dashboard application's architecture and user interface.
Create a dashboard arrangement that displays post-performance metrics.
Identify the technical stack, such as the backend server and frontend framework.
Make prototypes or wireframes to see how the dashboard will look.

Step 3: Development Goal: Put the dashboard application into use in accordance with the specifications and design.
Tasks: Configure Facebook authentication so that user data can be accessed.
Create front-end elements to show post-performance metrics.
Create backend services to retrieve and handle Facebook Graph API data.
In order to obtain and provide post-performance data, integrate the front end and back end.
To verify dependability and functionality, extensively test the program.

Step4: Deployment Goal: Make the dashboard application available to users.
Tasks: Select a hosting platform (such as AWS) for the application's deployment.
Set up the deployment parameters for scalability and security.
Install the program on the hosting platform of your choice.
Once the application is deployed, keep an eye out for any problems.

Step 5: Upkeep and Assistance
Goal: Assure the dashboard application's continuous enhancement and functionality.
Tasks: Offer user assistance and quickly resolve any issues that are reported.
Maintain the program on a regular basis to maintain it current with modifications to Facebook's API or user requirements.
Get user input for upcoming upgrades and improvements.


Explanation:
Conditions:
Access to Facebook Developer account.
fundamental knowledge of backend and frontend programming.

Steps: Use React to create a simple front-end application.
Incorporate Facebook login features for user authentication.
Using the user's access token, retrieve post-performance data from the Facebook Graph API.
On the frontend dashboard, show the data that was retrieved.
View post performance metrics and test the program by connecting in with a Facebook account.
In this demo, customers will be able to monitor their Facebook post performance metrics in real-time, showcasing the dashboard application's key features.
